Project - Near field photometric stereo

I have used the source code released by authors from the paper titled "Fast Light-Weight Near-Field Photometric Stereo" as my base code. All my changes are done on top of this.
This includes running the camera calibration for my images.
Estimating the surface normals and depth for any given set of images.
Estimating the 3D reconstruction using the 2D depth maps.
Alternative approach of estimating the depth through Poisson integration given the surface normals and the binary segmentation map of the object

Note: I faced a few problems while shifting the images in the report and they are not placed exactly where I want them in the report. But I have referenced them with appropriate figure numbers to avoid any confusion.
